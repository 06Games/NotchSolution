# Notch Solution

![screenshot](.Documentation/images/ssMain.gif)

It is a set of tools to fight with notched/cutout phones for Unity uGUI. Minimum Unity version **2019.1**.

## How to include with GitHub functionality of Unity Package Manager

Add this line `"com.e7.notch-solution": "git://github.com/5argon/NotchSolution.git",` to your `manifest.json`.

It does not update automatically when I push fixes to this repo. You must remove the lock line that appears in you `manifest.json` file to refectch. Otherwise you would better use Asset Store (when it is available)

## Reason for open source

I believe screen cutout problem must be solved collaboratively, since there are so many variations and potentially different permutation of problems. Over time we together could make this more stable than I could ever made alone.

The Discord channel [is also available here!](https://discord.gg/J4sCcj4) You could come and express your wishlist or issues. (You could also use the Issues section.)

## Asset Store

It will be on Unity Asset Store later too, but currently I don't think it is Asset Store worthy. There are some weird glitches remaining, and many usability issue related to the isolated prefab mode. (Prefab mode preview added in v1.2.0 but I am not sure of bugs)
